The goal of `healthyR.ts` is to provide a consistent verb framework for performing
time-series analysis and forecasting.

## Installation

You can install the released version of healthyR.ts from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("healthyR.ts")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("spsanderson/healthyR.ts")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(healthyR.ts)
library(ggplot2)

df <- ts_random_walk()

head(df)

df %>%
   ggplot(
       mapping = aes(
           x = x
           , y = cum_y
           , color = factor(run)
           , group = factor(run)
        )
    ) +
    geom_line(alpha = 0.8) +
    get_gg_layers(df)
```
