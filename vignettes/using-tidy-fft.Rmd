# Introduction

In this vignette we will discuss how to use the `tidy_fft` function, what it does,
and what it produces.

# The Function

The `tidy_fft` function has only a few parameters, six to be exact. There are some
sensible defaults made. It is important that when you use this function, that you
supply it with a full time-series data set, one that has no missing data in it as
this will affect your results.

## Funcation and Parameters

The function and its full parameters are as follows:

```r
tidy_fft(
  .data,
  .date_col,
  .value_col,
  .frequency = 12L,
  .harmonics = 1L,
  .upsampling = 10L
)
```
